In the beautiful sunshine of a warm summer days people gather at the park to enjoy picnics and outdoor activities childers played frisbee on the green grass while friends shared laughs under the shay of tall trees The smell of delicious bis fil the air as family's set up their grill Somone started singing folk songs and the melody drifted throug the breeze creating a peaceful atmosfere. As the sun began to set the sky turned rage and pinks casting a warm glow over the scenes It was a day of pure happiness and relaxation
