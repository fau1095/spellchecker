In the beautiful sunshine of a warm summer days people gathered at the park to enjoy picnics and outdoor activities childers played frisbee on the green grassy while friends shared laughs under the shay of tall trees The smell of delicious bal fil the air as family's set up their grille Somone stated singing folk songs and the melody drifted throug the breezed creating a peaceful atmosfere. As the sun began to sets the sky turned osage and pinko casting a warm glow over the scene It was a day of pure happiness and relaxation
